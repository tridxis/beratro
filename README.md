# The 365-Day GitHub Streak Challenge with Beratro

New Year, New Me! 🎉

This year, I’m challenge myself again. The mission is simple: ship code every single day. No excuses, no breaks. Just pure builder vibes.

What’s the alpha? I’m cooking up **BERATRO** an NFT Game inspired by Balatro, one of my all-time favorites. I’m a total game-aholic, so what better way to flex my dev skills than building one infused with the chaotic energy of Berachain?

Not just about streaks. It’s about pushing limits, leveling up, and creating something so addictive even I can’t stop playing it 🚀

So, here’s to a year of grinding, shipping, and staying giga-brain. Let’s make it legendary. Builders gonna build 🛠️ 🐻‍❄️

## Vibes

Crazy things need crazy guys. Drop your wildest ideas in a PR, and I’ll cook them right into this game.

## Zero-To-One Diary

I’ll write down every experience I go through, from ideas to execution. Inspired by fellow builders, I hope these logs create a domino effect, sparking something in you.

# Okay Let's Start

## Day 1

Keeping the gameplay of Balatro would be easy, but I’m going to tweak it a bit—making it more defi and chaotic.

Some ideas today:

- I will change game's signature from Joker to the Bera Bera. Guess where I’m getting the art for these bears? I’ll **snap** any bear I come across and turn it into lore and functionality for the game. 🐻📸

**Examples**:

| Bera | Ability | 
|---|---|
| ![Frame 3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3ca6ecf-e7bc-40c6-92b6-6d3401805865)  |  Saw its mouth and thought it looked like diamond. This one’s definitely +4 Mult for the Diamond suit 💎🐻 |
|![Frame 4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/634b88cd-3bc0-4650-9bb7-4668e2049012) | This shy little kid is gonna give you +1.5 Mult for every face-down card in your hand. Cooool!!!  | 

Notice the star on the card? Balatro doesn’t have this, huh? What’s it for? Stay tuned for tomorrow’s reveal! 🌟🃏
